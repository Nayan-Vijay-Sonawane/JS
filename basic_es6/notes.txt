PART-1: How the Web Works (Conceptual Foundation)

1. What happen when you open a website?
    - Browser sends a request to a server.
    - server responds with files.
        HTML (structure)
        CSS (styling)
        JavaScript (behavior)
    - Browser builds the page using the DOM

2. What is DOM?
    DOM = Document Object Model
    - Browser converts HTML into a tree of objects
    - JavaScript can (read elements, change text, responds to user actions)
    (React exists because manual DOM manipulation becomes messy and slow in big apps)

3. Why frameworks like react exists
    Problem with plain JS:
    - Manually update the DOM
    - Code becomes hard to manage
    - Bugs increase as app grows

    React solution:
    - Describe the what the UI should look like
    - React updates the DOM efficiently using Virtual DOM
    React = Decalarativ UI + Component based architecture
