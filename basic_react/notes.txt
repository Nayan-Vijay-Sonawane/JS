PART-1 : What is React (Proper Mental Model)

    - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - Build around Components
    - UI is a function of state

    Component-Based Architecture
        - each piece has its own logic, is reusable, easy to maintain.
    

PART-2 : Virtual DOM 

    - The Problem(Old Way)
    document.queryselector("#title).innerText = "Hello";
        - manual updates
        - slow
        - bug-prone

    - React's solution
        - React creates a Virtual DOM (copy of real DOM)
        - Virtual DOM is an in-memory lightweight copy of real DOM.
        - when we update the UI, react doesn't touch the real DOM directly.
          Instead, 1. Updates the Virtual DOM first
                   2. compare it with previous Virtual DOM snapshots (Diffing)
                   3. Applies only required changes to the real DOM (reconciliation).
