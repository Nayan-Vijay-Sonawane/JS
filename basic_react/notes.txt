PART-1 : What is React (Proper Mental Model)

    - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - Build around Components
    - UI is a function of state

    Component-Based Architecture
        - each piece has its own logic, is reusable, easy to maintain.
    

PART-2 : Virtual DOM 

    - The Problem(Old Way)
    document.queryselector("#title).innerText = "Hello";
        - manual updates
        - slow
        - bug-prone

    - React's solution
        - React creates a Virtual DOM (copy of real DOM)
        - Virtual DOM is an in-memory lightweight copy of real DOM.
        - when we update the UI, react doesn't touch the real DOM directly.
          Instead, 1. Updates the Virtual DOM first
                   2. compare it with previous Virtual DOM snapshots (Diffing)
                   3. Applies only required changes to the real DOM (reconciliation).

PART-3 : React Project structure

    File structure
        - index.html -> entry point of the application, contains root DOM.
        - main.jsx -> react app entry file, Mounts react to the DOM (connect react to the browser DOM)
        - App.jsx -> root Component (when the page loads this is the first executing file), holds layout and main UI logic


PART-4 : JSX (JavaScript XML) and Component

    - Its a modern code fir writing HTML and JS together
    - Browser don't understand the JSX so need to convert that into plain JS so Babel(compiler) comes in which converts that and render's also
    - JSX Rules 
        1. Must return one parent element
        2. Use className, not class
        3. JavaScript inside {}

    - Component
        - It is a reusable piece of code to define certain part of UI.
        - Functional Component is far better than class component and easy to use
        - Class Component is old and we have to use advanced JS for that(complex).

PART-5 : Props (Passing Data to Components)

    What are props?
    props = data passed from parent to child component. (Think props like function arguments)
    - Data usually lives higher up
    - UI pieces live lower down
    so React needs a way to send data down -> props

    Rules-
    - Props are read only(Immutable)
    - Child cannot modify props
    - Data flows one direction (top -> down)


PART-6 : State (Dynamic Data)
    
    Why State Exists?
    let count = 0;
    count = count + 1;
        - UI will not update
        - react doesn't track normal variables
        - So React introduces State
    
    What is state
        - Data owned by a component
        - When it changes -> UI updates automatically
        - State change = re-render

    useState Hook
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
        - count = Current value
        - setCount = Function to update value
        - 0 = initial value
        (This is array destructuring)

    useEffect Hook
    useEffect(() => {
        // Effect logic
    }, [])
        - Allow side effects in function component
        When runs
            - After the first render(component mounts)
            - After every updates(re-renders), if no dependency array is provided
            - can be controlled by passing dependency array to trigger the effect only when specific state or props change


PART-7 : Events (user interaction)
    - User interaction with the application
    Examples: clicks, form submissions, key presses

    - Event handler
        The function that handles the event is written as a method within the component
