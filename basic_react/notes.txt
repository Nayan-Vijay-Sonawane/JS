PART-1 : What is React (Proper Mental Model)

    - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - Build around Components
    - UI is a function of state

    Component-Based Architecture
        - each piece has its own logic, is reusable, easy to maintain.
    

PART-2 : Virtual DOM 

    - The Problem(Old Way)
    document.queryselector("#title).innerText = "Hello";
        - manual updates
        - slow
        - bug-prone

    - React's solution
        - React creates a Virtual DOM (copy of real DOM)
        - Virtual DOM is an in-memory lightweight copy of real DOM.
        - when we update the UI, react doesn't touch the real DOM directly.
          Instead, 1. Updates the Virtual DOM first
                   2. compare it with previous Virtual DOM snapshots (Diffing)
                   3. Applies only required changes to the real DOM (reconciliation).

PART-3 : React Project structure

    File structure
        - index.html -> entry point of the application, contains root DOM.
        - main.jsx -> react app entry file, Mounts react to the DOM (connect react to the browser DOM)
        - App.jsx -> root Component (when the page loads this is the first executing file), holds layout and main UI logic


PART-4 : JSX (JavaScript XML) and Component

    - Its a modern code fir writing HTML and JS together
    - Browser don't understand the JSX so need to convert that into plain JS so Babel(compiler) comes in which converts that and render's also
    - JSX Rules 
        1. Must return one parent element
        2. Use className, not class
        3. JavaScript inside {}

    - Component
        - It is a reusable piece of code to define certain part of UI.
        - Functional Component is far better than class component and easy to use
        - Class Component is old and we have to use advanced JS for that(complex).

PART-5 : Props (Passing Data to Components)

    What are props?
    props = data passed from parent to child component. (Think props like function arguments)

    Rules-
    - Props are read only(Immutable)
    - Child cannot modify props
    - Data flows one direction (top -> down)
